## Recommendations

- If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

  - **Incetivizing non-accredited investors to buy 'microshares' by offering investor classes in exchange for long-term purchases. Smaller buyers may be interested in short-term turn-around shares, minimizing collective equity.Incentivizing these buyers with value-added educational courses offers a two-fold benefit: more buyers stay invested longer, increasing the total equity pool, but also investing in the educational future of investors who may want to grow their investment strategies. This is esepcially vauable when seeking opportunities to increase economic equity in underserved communities**

- Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

  - _See above_

- What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

  - _Smartphone app with educational course library_

- Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

  - _Smartphones are ubiquitous and a great tool to increase accesibility_

## Of Note

- Cadre, along with nearly two dozen other FinTech companies, joined the **FinTech Equality Coalitian** to commit to creating greater racial equity, especially for black people, both in and outside the FinTech sector. [[7](#references)]

- Cadre formalized _Juneteenth_ as a permanent company holiday. [[8](#references)]

- As of early 2020, Jared Kushner sold his remaining stake of _Cadre_ [[9](#references)]
